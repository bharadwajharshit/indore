            <h2>History</h2> <!--Calling class in a same page-->
            <p class="description">The city of Indore was established by Malhar Rao Holkar, Commander-in-Chief of the Maratha army in the year 1732, On 29 July 1732, Peshwa Bajirao granted Malwa province to Malhar Rao Holkar by merging 28 and a half parganas to Malhar Rao Holkar, the founding ruler of the Holkar dynasty and then established city of Indore. His daughter-in-law Ahilyabai Holkar moved the state's capital to Maheshwar in 1767, but Indore remained an important commercial and military centre. The city was ruled by other Holkar rulers viz. Maharaja Shivaji Rao Holkar, Maharaja Khande Rao Holkar, Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar, Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar who continued to rule and developed the city that majorly includes town development, trade and transportation, city expansion etc.
            After the independence of India in 1947, Indore State, along with a number of neighbouring princely states, acceded to India. Yashwant Rao Holkar II, the last ruler of the state, signed the instrument of accession to the Indian Union on 1 January 1950. The territories of the state became part of the new Indian state of Madhya Bharat.</p>
