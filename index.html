                <p class="description">Indore is a largest city in central India known for its food, cleanliness,
                    industries and climate. Indore has won title of India's cleanest city continuously for 4 times.
                    It is also regarded as the commercial capital of Madhya Pradesh state. Indore is a well known
                    city that is considered as educational hub in India and the first city having campuses of both
                    IIM and IIT. Indore also stands proudly to have Indian Army cantonment known as MHOW (Military
                    Headquarter of War) and also serves as a home to three eminent institutes viz. Army War College,
                    Infantry School and Military College of Telecommunication Engineering. All three institutes are
                    established in MHOW and many Indian Army personnels are trained here. The Border Security Force
                    (BSF) has its Central School of Weapons and Tactics (CSWT) at Indore.
                </p>
                <p class="description">The city of Indore was established by Malhar Rao Holkar, Commander-in-Chief
                    of the Maratha army in the year 1732, On 29 July 1732, Peshwa Bajirao granted Malwa province to
                    Malhar Rao Holkar by merging 28 and a half parganas to Malhar Rao Holkar, the founding ruler of
                    the Holkar dynasty and then established city of Indore. His daughter-in-law Ahilyabai Holkar
                    moved the state's capital to Maheshwar in 1767, but Indore remained an important commercial and
                    military centre. The city was ruled by other Holkar rulers viz. Maharaja Shivaji Rao Holkar,
                    Maharaja Khande Rao Holkar, Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar, Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar who
                    continued to rule and developed the city that majorly includes town development, trade and
                    transportation, city expansion etc.
                    After the independence of India in 1947, Indore State, along with a number of neighbouring
                    princely states, acceded to India. Yashwant Rao Holkar II, the last ruler of the state, signed
                    the instrument of accession to the Indian Union on 1 January 1950. The territories of the state
                    became part of the new Indian state of Madhya Bharat.

                <p class="description">Indore lies on a borderline between a humid subtropical climate and a
                    tropical savanna climate. Because of its high elevation and inland location even during the
                    hottest months the nights are relatively cool, which is known as <em>Shab-e-Malwa</em>.
